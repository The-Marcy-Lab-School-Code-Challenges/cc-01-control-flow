### example.js

In this file, there are two functions. To test the functions, you can run `node example.js` within this repo. 

### 🧠 `checkValue`

- Tests different values (like strings, numbers, `null`, etc.)
- Shows how JavaScript decides if a value is **truthy** or **falsy**
- Helps us see what will make a conditional statement run

### 📝 `assignGrade`

- Takes in a test score (0–100)
- Uses `if / else if / else` to choose which letter grade to return
- Shows how to write to pass data through control flow with conditionals

## index.js

Write a function called `outfitPicker` that:

- Takes in a temperature (`temp`), which is a number type
- Uses **if / else if / else** statements
- Returns an **outfit suggestion** (as a string) based on the temperature
